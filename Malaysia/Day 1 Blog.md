# Preparation:

I was planning to go to malaysia for quite a long time. As it was a developed country and also it was within my budget to visit this country. 
After to much pressure for my university, I got the chance to visit in the Eid-ul-azha vacation. So I purchased the ticket and booked and paid for hotel bookings .

The ticket costs around **53K**, normally you can get a round trip ticket for about **44K**, but it was the eid season, So the price was a bit high. Note: [You should purchase round trip ticket non stop ticket, if you do one way you will not get boarding pass from bangladesh airport. Or even you do multi city, [IE, 1 stop ticket, where there is a transit in country like india or other, you will also not get boarding pass, or if you do get boarding pass you will some hassle. 
Ok, now the hotel booking cost around **15k**, 7 days. 


**So up to now, total cost was [53+15] = 68K**.


I also did a research of about 2 days, and created an intinerary for 7 days, in Kualalmpur and Penang George town.


# 25 May, Depart from Dhaka airport:

TIme: 8 pm. 


I came to airport at 4.30pm. I thought I was early, but oh boooooy.  There was a huge line, just at the entrence of the airport.  There was a huge line in taking the boarding pass too. After that I went to immigration immidiatly, as I know that there will be a huge line there too. 

And there was.........

**I asked around to people and pretty soon realied why country like malaysia so doesn't trust our people, and see us in a very low class eyes. Many people are going there with tourist visa, but for the purpose of staying there, as their relative or some middle man is waiting**


After the huge line in immigration, As everything of mine was ok,  I was reased begfore time. 

For immigration on both part I brought the following documents. 

1 Passport 
2 e Visa Printout 
3 Air Ticket 
4 Paid Hotel bookings. 
5 Student ID card 
6  Job agreement 
7 Itinerary 
8 Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (3 days before) 
9. Take all file  to mac, zip  Photoesâ€¦
10.  2 passport size photo, (just in case, not for immigraiotn, for other purposes))
11. NID card.


at 9.30 pm the plane departed. It made about 1 hour late. which is ok I guess. But the whole plane journy wasn't that comfortable. the plane was overloaded. 
But the food was amazing. that I have to say..



# 26 May at Kualalampur city (day 1)


Arrivaed at the airport around 3.30 am. Went to immigration. 
Was a little bit nervous, not gonna lie, as there were soo many bangladeshi, even I talked to them and found problems with documentation and their intention.

When I went close to immigration, I even saw 3 bangladeshi which were stopped. I guess there were some problems with documentation or may be their intetion. 

I talked with one person, that I found, the person was complete clueless.  **AS most of the people of our country**

Then I turned on my **Devil may care, confidence mode on.**

While presenting the ducments, I first presented the visa, digital arrival card , and spoke a line of english **Here is my Visa, Digital arrival arrival card**. Then I gave my return ticket and booking. and spoke another line of english **Here is my return ticket and paid(with a clear voice) hotel bookings**.  And that's it.  **Just two line of english with clear voice, my immigration was done.**

The officer didn't even checked my other docuemnt, as they were expereiced and mostly can tell by just looking at the person whether his intention if true or false. 

But all I can say, **If your intention is true, be confident, that's it**

After everything is done, I purchased a Sim card. cost around **30 RM**.

**[Cost 30 RM - SIM]**.  


I ate a breakfast, costs around [17 RM]

**[ Cost 17 RM]**

cost was a bit high, but I was extrememly hungry.

Then I took a lift, which went under ground. in the floor 1, there was the **KLIA EKspres** train, that runs from the airport to **KL Sentral** which is the city center.


[Include map from KLIA to KL sentral of KLIA ekspress]

**[Train cost was 55 RM]**

after the train I came to **KL sentral** . And It was huge, the station, I had a very hard time just to nevigate. 


Than I wanted to take a taxi, but the taxi app **Grab**, needed to pay first before giving me a service. As it was night I avoided that. 

My hotel was around **3.8KM** away, I decided to walk. 



[Include map from KL sentral to my Hotel chinatown internation]



I had a hard time nevigating the location, and the roads. As there was seperate **Walk** route for every road. And also it was night, and morning lisght does come to malaysia before 7 am. and it was around 6 am. 

Ok, while walking I found the street of KL was so well organized. Everysingle car follows the traffic law strickly. Even the raod is complete clear, the cars still doesn't pass. which was really good. All the roads are very well color coded.

I took some pictures too.
