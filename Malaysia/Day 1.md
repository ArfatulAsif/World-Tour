# Preparation:

I was planning to go to **Malaysia** for quite a long time, as it is a developed country and also within my budget. After too much pressure from my university, I got the chance to visit during the **Eid-ul-Azha** vacation. So I purchased the ticket and booked and paid for **hotel bookings**.

The ticket costs around **53 K BDT**; normally you can get a round-trip ticket for about **44 K BDT**, but it was the Eid season, so the price was a bit high. **Note:** You should purchase a non-stop round-trip ticket—if you do one-way, you will not get a boarding pass from Bangladesh airport. Even if you do a multi-city ticket (i.e., one stop in a country like India), you will also not get a boarding pass easily, or if you do get one, you will face some hassle.
Ok, now the hotel booking cost around **15 K BDT** for **7 days**.

**So up to now, total cost was \[53 + 15] = 68 K BDT.**

I also did research for about **2 days** and created an **itinerary** for **7 days** in **Kuala Lumpur** and **Penang (George Town)**.

# 25 May, Depart from **Dhaka Airport**

**Time:** **8:00 pm**

I came to the airport at **4:30 pm**. I thought I was early, but oh boy—there was a huge line just at the entrance of the airport. There was a huge line for taking the boarding pass too. After that, I went to immigration immediately, as I knew there would be a huge line there too.

And there was…

**I asked around to people and pretty soon realized why a country like Malaysia doesn’t trust our people and sees us with very low-class eyes. Many people go there on tourist visas but stay illegally, as their relative or some middleman is waiting.**

After the huge line at immigration, as everything of mine was OK, I was released before time.

For immigration (both ways) I brought the following documents:

1. **Passport**
2. **eVisa printout**
3. **Air ticket**
4. **Paid hotel bookings confirmation**
5. **Student ID card**
6. **Job agreement**
7. **Itinerary**
8. **Malaysia Digital Arrival Card** (submitted **3 days before**)
9. All files zipped on my Mac (photos, etc.)
10. Two **passport-size photos** (just in case, not for immigration, for other purposes)
11. **NID card**

At **9:30 pm** the plane departed. It was about **1 hour** late, which is OK I guess. But the whole plane journey wasn’t comfortable—the plane was overloaded. **But the food was amazing**, I have to say.

# 26 May at **Kuala Lumpur** (Day 1)

Arrived at the airport around **3:30 am**. Went to immigration. Was a little bit nervous, not gonna lie, as there were so many Bangladeshis—I even talked to some and found problems with their documentation and their intention.

When I went close to immigration, I saw three Bangladeshis who were stopped. I guess there were some problems with documentation or maybe their intention.

I talked with one person I found; the person was completely clueless. **As most of the people of our country.**

Then I turned on my **Devil-may-care, confidence mode**.

While presenting the documents, I first showed the visa and Digital Arrival Card, and spoke a line in English: **“Here is my visa and Digital Arrival Card.”** Then I gave my return ticket and booking, and spoke another line in English: **“Here is my return ticket and paid hotel booking.”** And that’s it. **Just two lines in English with a clear voice, and my immigration was done.**

The officer didn’t even check my other documents, as they are experienced and can mostly tell by looking at the person whether his intention is true or false.

But all I can say: **If your intention is true, be confident—that’s it.**

After everything was done, I purchased a SIM card. **Cost: 30 RM**.

I ate breakfast, **costing 17 RM**—it was a bit high, but I was extremely hungry.

Then I took an underground lift. On Floor 1, there was the **KLIA Ekspres** train that runs from the airport to **KL Sentral**, which is the city center.

**Train cost: 55 RM** 

After the train, I arrived at **KL Sentral**, and it was huge—I had a very hard time just to navigate.

Then I wanted to take a taxi, but the Grab app needed prepayment before giving the service. As it was night, I avoided that.

My hotel was around **3.8 km** away, so I decided to walk.

I had a hard time navigating the location and the roads, as there was a separate **walk** route for every street. Also, it was night, and morning light doesn’t come to Malaysia before **7 am**—it was around **6 am**.

Ok, while walking I found the streets of **KL** so well organized. Every single car follows traffic laws strictly. Even when the road is completely clear, the cars still don’t pass, which was really good. All the roads are very well color coded.

I took some pictures too.

After coming back to the hotel, I directly went to sleep. Early check-in had an extra cost: **50 RM**. 



I woke up at **3:00 pm**, didn’t waste time, and went for a walk around **Bukit Bintang**.

I followed my itinerary.



## Jalan Alor Street Food


I walked around and had lunch. **Lunch cost: 24 RM**.

## KL Aquaria

<img src="images/Day 1/aquaria_map.jpg">

Funny thing—the Aquaria is at the **KLCC Convention Centre**, where the **ASEAN Summit** was going on at the time. There was so much security. I was surprised—on a normal city hall that much security, but later realized why.

**Aquaria cost: 75 RM**.

To be honest, a complete waste of money—Cox’s Bazar Radiant Sea World was more worth it.

## KLCC Park

That was so worth it. Oh man, it was amazing. I wandered around the park. 

<img src="images/Day 1/park_entry.jpg">

I went to the center of the park. There it was: **Kuala Lumpur City**

**CITY of Skyscrapers**

**Petronas Twin Towers** and KLCC Park photos.

Along the way, I purchased some drinks from the supermarket and some night food for the hotel, **costing 40 RM**. 


Later, I walked back to the hotel, visiting **Jalan Alor Road** for the night view. 

<img src="images/Day 1/jalan_alor_night.jpg">

That ended my day. It cost way more than expected because it was the first day and I had to figure out everything.

Total cost was around **310 RM**, including the ATM charge of **22 RM**.

### Total Day 1 cost was around **300 RM** or **9,000 BDT**.

Just one more thing before I go for today: as I am writing from my hotel after Day 1, I want to remind people coming to **Kuala Lumpur** that the hotel socket is not like ours.

Thank goodness I borrowed a power bank from my friend.
