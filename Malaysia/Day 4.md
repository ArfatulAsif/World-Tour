# Day 4, 29 May, moving day from KL to Georgetown.

didn’t sleep at night, woke up early and left for the **ETS train** at **7:00 am**, took a Grab for **12 RM**

Boy, what do you know, all **tickets** for **ETS train** are **sold out** for **29, 30 May**. I kind of got a shock; I asked around, “Is there any other solution?” I really wanted to ride that train, as it is a fast train covering **360 KM** in just **4 hours**, from **KL Sentral** to **Butterworth**.

Ok, then what, I remembered there **were buses** when I first came to **KL Sentral** and was figuring out my ways on the first day. So I navigated there too, asked around—**all tickets to Butterworth** are sold, only **8:00 pm** available.

**Drama.** Kind of got a shock, started looking for a flight immediately, and almost did the **12:00 pm** flight booking, but luck.

**Luck**, I saw a Google sponsored ad, and clicked—it showed buses leaving from some place called **TBS** to **Butterworth**, with seats available every **10 minutes**.

So I did not do the flight booking, took a Grab to **TBS**.

Ok, there I purchased the first ticket I got hold of, which was at **9:00 am**, and it was already **8:45 am**.

**\[Ticket cost: 53 RM]** – wayyyyy cheaper than flight.

One thing I should mention is that they ask for **Passport** to do the ticketing.

From **9:00 am** to **3:45 pm**, the journey was so comfortable, I slept through most of it. The roads were nice.

Then we came to **Butterworth**, and I found out that I left the **ferry behind**.
The bus conductor didn’t understand a word of English; he was telling me something, he was annoyed, I was annoyed.

**A kind—and I think very educated—woman sitting in front of me told me that the ferry is quite far behind; I have to take the Grab taxi.**

I took Grab for **15 RM**, original price was **13 RM**; for the first time one driver asked for a **2 RM** tip. In my entire journey, this happened only today.


Took the ferry to **Georgetown**.

**Ferry cost was 2 RM.**

Immediately entered the hotel, which was very nearby.

**[Extra tax – 30 RM]**

After shower I immediately headed out without spending any time.

I stayed at **Queen Street**, where my hotel is.

I first ate lunch at **Nasi Kandar** for **15 RM**.


## Visiting street arts.

Went to **Chulia Street** and **Armenian Street**, to watch the **street arts**.

These places were very nearby, within **400 m**. So just by walking I went there.

**I always had to ask people to take pictures of me; I had to find young people, as older people don’t know how to take a good picture.**

Then when I asked for a picture from two people who looked like Bangladeshis, they told me **“Ok tule dicci”**, which means “Ok, capturing your photo.” I was surprised; I had a great chat with them. Learned that they have been here working for around **2 years**. They offered to take me to **Chew Jetty**, one of the most visited places near the sea.

**Normally, whenever I meet people who are kind to me for no reason, I remain suspicious and wait for any bad clues in talking or suspicious acting.**
**But these two people were so kind at heart and down to earth, there were zero signs.**

## Chew Jetty


I had a great time with them; they were funny, realistic, told me all about Georgetown and their experiences.

After that we came to the **Masjid Kapitan Keling** for **Maghrib**, met with more Bangladeshi brothers.

**One thing I should mention is that they were here illegally, but that didn’t matter to them; they have built a great community here in this area by avoiding police.**

We laughed together, then performed **Maghrib salat** at the mosque.

The Kapitan Keling Mosque is around **200 years** old.

After that, one of the Bangladeshi brothers called **Sazid** told me to knock him around **10:00 pm**, he would take me to the nightlife of the city.

**Again, I should say, there was no complexity in them, just kind and down to earth.**

I got out around **10:00 pm**.

We went to **Padang Kota**, meaning field; it was near the ocean.

## Padang Kota

The kind brother paid for my tea, even though I insisted so much. We enjoyed **Padang Kota**, vibrant field and seaside.

Then wandered around the city a little bit at night. And it was around **1:00 am**. We came to Masjid Kapitan Keling.

I had dinner here, and let me tell you, this is the best food I had on my entire trip. Cost was around **10 RM**.


It was roasted chicken with other soups.

I then headed home.

## Total cost was around **170 RM** with water, juice, and other stuff (some I missed to mention).
