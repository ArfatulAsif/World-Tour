# Day 4, 29 May, moving day from KL to georgetown.


didnt sleept at night, woke up early and left for the **ETS train** at **7 am**, took a grab for  12 RM

**[ Grab 12 RM]**

Boy, what do you know, all ticker for ETS train is sold for 29, 30 May. I kind of got a shock, I aksed around is there any other solution, I really wanted to ride that train. As it is a fast train covering 360 KM in just 4 hours. From KL sentral to buttorworth. 


Ok, then what, I remembered there were bus when I first came to KL sentral and figuring out my ways, in first day. So I nevigated there too, asked around all ticket to buttorworth are sold. only 8pm avialble.

**Drama**. Kind of got a shock, started looking for flight, immidiaty , and almost did the 12 pm flight booking, but luck.

**LUck**, I saw a google sponsored add, and clicked and show buses leaving from some place called **TBS** to **BUtterworth** and there were also so many seat availble and busses leaving in every 10 minuts. 

SO I didnot do the booking, tood a grab to TBS

Ok, there i purchased the first ticket I got hold, which was at 9 am, and it was already 8,45 am.   


**[ticket cost 53 RM]** - wayyyyy cheaper than flight. 

ONe thing I should mention that they ask for **Passport** to do the ticketing.

From 9 am to 3.45 pm, the journy was so comfortable, I slept through most of it. The road were nice. 


Then we came in butterworth, I found out that I left the **Ferry behind**. 

The bus conductor didn't undertood a word of english, he was tellin me somegint, he was annoyed, I was annoyed. 

**A kind, and I think very educated woman, setting in front of me told me that ferry is quite far behind, I have to take the Grab texi**


I took grab for 15 RM, original price was 13 RM, for the first time one driver asked for 2 RM tip. IN my entire journey, this happened only today.

These place were very nearby, within **400m**. So just by walking I went there.




**I always had to ask people to take picture of me, I had to find young people, as older people doesnt know How to take a good picture**



Then When I asked for a picture to two people, looks like bangladeshi, they told me **"ok tule dicci** whihc means "ok captureing your photo"" , 

I was surprised, I had a great chat with them. Learned that they are here working for aorund 2 years. 
They offered me to take to **Chey jetty** one of the most visited place near sea.


**NOrmally whenever I met people who are kind to me for no reason, I remain suspicious and wait for any bad clues in talking or suspicicous acting**


**But these two people were so kind to heart and down to earth, there were zero sign**

**one thing I should mention, that they were here illigally, but that didn't matter to them , they have built a great community here, in this area by avoiding polics**

We laughted togather  then performed magrib salat at the mostque
