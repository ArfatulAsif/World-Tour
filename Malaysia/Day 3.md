# Day 3: (Batu Cave and KL Night Bus Tour)

I woke up quite late, it was around **3:00 pm**. Yeah, that late—I slept through the morning because I actually wandered near my hotel at night for some nighttime snacks and drank a cup of tea.

## Batu Cave

Ok, then my schedule was to go to the **KL Sentral** station and then go to **Batu Cave** via the **KTM Komuter** train. But I did the math: if I did this, and then returned to catch the **8:00 pm** night bus, I would miss it. And boy, I was **extremely** right.

I used **GRAB** and booked a taxi ride from my hotel to **Batu Cave**, which cost only **18 RM**, a much cheaper route.

The cave was amazing, huge, **enormous**. I got so tired getting to the top and entering the cave. I did quite a bit of a photo session inside the cave.

I also played around with a **pigeon** in front of the cave.

I met some fellow **Bangladeshi** students studying **CS in Malaysia**. I talked with them and learned about their internships and other experiences. We had a great laugh about our country too. The punch line they told me: “When you mention you are Bangladeshi, your value automatically drops to 30%.”

They also told me something more interesting: in **Singapore**, Bangladeshis are much respected, as they follow laws perfectly. Also, **Bengali** is the second language.

Then, as I mentioned, I wanted to ride the **KTM Komuter** train. So I went to the Batu Cave platform and bought a ticket costing **5.5 RM**.


It was already around **6:30 pm**, and my **8:00 pm** night bus time was getting near. Then I booked another **GRAB taxi**. Surprise—the taxi cost around **29 RM** from **KL Sentral** to **Sungei Wang Plaza**, which is way more than the **18 RM** price from my hotel to Batu Cave. But Batu Cave to my hotel is **11 km**, and KL Sentral to Wang Plaza is **3 km**. I guess it’s the city and this was peak time.

So going to Batu Cave directly with Grab taxi cost **18 RM**, but coming back via KTM Komuter + taxi to Wang Plaza cost around **35 RM**.


## KL City Night Bus Tour

Ok, as I waited for the bus (which was around **8:00 pm**, and it was **7:20 pm**), I thought, why not try something from a brand like **Pizza Hut** or **Burger King**?

Then I had a burger at **Burger King**.


After the burger, I headed to the **KL City Night Bus Tour** at **Sungei Wang Plaza**. I think the plaza is some sort of famous city hall, like New Market of Dhaka. I actually found so many stalls along with places for karate, go-karting, etc.

Ok, after that I went for the city night bus. The bus ride was about **2 hours**, and it covered:
– **KL Tower** 🗼
– **Chinatown** 🏮
– **Central Market** 🎨
– **Little India** 🎊
– **KL Sentral** 🚉
– **National Palace** 🏰
– **Merdeka Square** 🏞️
– **KLCC – The Twin Towers** 🌉

After the bus ride, I went to **Jalan Alor Road** for some food.

I walked back to the hotel and got some night snacks for my bedtime. I took some night food **10 RM**.

## Total cost Day 3: **102 RM**
