# Day 3: (batu cave and KL night bus tour)

I woke up quite late, its around 3 pm. Yeah that late, I slept through the morning, because I actually wonder near my hotel at night for some night time snacks, and drank a cup of tea.


## BAtu cave 

Ok, then my schedule was to go to the KL Sentral station and then go to **Batu Cave** via the **KTM KOMUTER** train. 
But I did the math, if I do this, and then return and try to catch the 8 pm night bus, I would miss it. And Boy I was extremly right.

I use **GRAB** and booked a taxi ride, from my hotel to batu cave. And took only 18 RM. which is a much cheaper route.

The cave was amazing, huge, gynormas. I got so much tired getting to the top and entering the cave. I did quite some photosession inside the cave.

I also played around with piegeon in front of the cave.

I also met with some fellow bangladeshi student studying CS in malaysia. I talked with them also learn about their internship and other experiences . We had a great laughter about our country too. The punch line told by them is that , "when you mention you are bangladeshi, your value automatically drops to 30%"

Then as I mentioned I wanted to ride the KTM KOMUTER TRAIN. So I went to the batu cave plartform and bought a ticket cost 5.5 RM.

it was already around 6.30 pm and my 8pm night bus time is getting near.
Then I booked a **GRAB taxi**

Surprise, the taxi costs around **29 RM.**
from **KL sentral** to **sungei wang plaza**,  which is wayyy more than 18 RM price from my hotel to batu cave directly.  But batu cave to my hotel is 11 KM. and KL sentral to wang plaza is 3 km.  I guess its the city and this was peak time.

So going to batu cave direcly with Grab taxi cost 18 RM. But coming from there using KTM KOMUTER + TAXI TO WAng plaza cost around 35 RM.

## KL CITY NIGHT BUS TOUR

Ok as I waited for the bus, which was around 8 pm, and it was 7 .20 pm
So I thought why not try something of brand like pizza hut or burger king.


Then I went for burger at burger king. 

**[Burger 10 RM]**

AFter the barger, I came for the KL CITY NIGHT BUS TOUR at **Sungei wang plaza**


I thinkg the plaza is some sort of like famous city hall. Like new market of dhaka.
I acutaly found so many stall along with places for karate, go karting,....



Ok after that I went for the city night bus. 

The bus ride was about 2 hours, and it covered
