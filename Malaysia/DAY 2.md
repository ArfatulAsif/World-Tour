# Day 2 : More city travel and top of the city view.


wake up around 2 pm. Then had a cup of coffe at home. 
Found that I had no charge on my powerbank. 
So I walked to the hotel counter for an adapter, and they did help me with one. But unfortunaltly it is not working. I kind of got freaked out. As without my phone, its like losing my **eye**. So i planed to buy an adapter when I come to hotel after touring the city, keep that in mind. 

"If you travel to malaysia, make sure to bring 3 pin adapter. "

Ok after that I boarded out for KL tower at 3 am.

## KL Tower

I was very tired to travel around 2 KM. So I was sweaty, at the first floor of the KL tower, I had a joice, costing 5 RM

**[ cost of joice 5 RM]**

In malaysia cost of joice and cane and other stuff like coca cola or pepsi are not autmatically determined, vendors have the right to set the prices. 

Ok after my drink, I bought a ticket for the observation deck only costing around 80 RM.


**[Cost of ticket 80 rm]**

the sky deck ticket was 140 RM, which was around 2K bdt more. so I made a choice.



I saw the city from the sky deck, which is around 80 storied hight.

To be honest, i wasnt that surprised from the top view. I actually had better top view from Sarangkot nepal. 

Ok I guess. 
Then I went to ground floor and headed out.


## Mashjid India

then I headed for mashjid india

**After all. the walking I became so tired and finally for teh first time I used GRAB app for taxi to hotel**

**one thing to remember that you can board to taxi from any places. for each type of taxi there are designatioed places for boarding , for which I had a hard time navigating in the map,
I had to go back and forth from google map and GRAB app map to find the boarding place of taxi

**[Taxi ride cos around 8 rm but I tipped total 10 RM]**

Funnything about the driver, he is police officier by day and taxi driver by night. 

I had a great chat with him, and he was a local but of indian decent , grew up in malaysia. 

I acutaly tipped him 2 RM more. He asked my agian again you sure you sure. I realised they are very professional and doesn't espect tips.
