# Day 2: More City Travel and Top-of-the-City View

I woke up around **2:00 pm**. Then I had a cup of **coffee** at home.
I found that I had no charge on my **power bank**, so I walked to the hotel counter for an **adapter**, and they did help me with one. But unfortunately, it was not working. I kind of got freaked out—without my phone, it’s like losing an **eye**. So I planned to buy an adapter when I returned to the hotel after touring the city—keep that in mind.

> “If you travel to **Malaysia**, make sure to bring a **3-pin adapter**.”

Ok, after that I headed out for **KL Tower** at **3:00 pm**.

## KL Tower

I was very tired after traveling around **2 km**, so I was sweaty. On the first floor of the **KL Tower**, I had a **juice**, costing **5 RM**.
In **Malaysia**, cost of juice, cane, and other stuff like **Coca-Cola** or **Pepsi** are not automatically determined—vendors have the right to set the prices.

Ok, after my drink, I bought a ticket for the observation deck, costing around **80 RM**.
The sky-deck ticket was **140 RM**, which was around **2K BDT** more, so I made a choice.
I saw the city from the sky deck, which is around **80 stories high**.

To be honest, I wasn’t that surprised by the top view. I actually had a better top view from **Sarangkot, Nepal**. Ok, I guess. Then I went to the ground floor and headed out.

## Masjid India

Then I headed for **Masjid India**. 


On my way, I had **lunch**, costing around **14.5 RM**. After that, I continued walking to **Masjid India**.

It was not that surprising; it was ok, I guess. It was the time of **Asr salat**.

## Independence Square and Sultan Abdul Samad

I then headed for the **Independence Square** and **Sultan Abdul Samad**. 


I took some **photos** and continued **walking**.

## National Mosque of Malaysia

After that, I went to the **National Mosque of Malaysia**. 


I went for **Asr salat**. I saw there are separate sections for men and women; women had a place for salat at the back.

After all the walking, I became so tired and finally, for the first time, I used the **GRAB app** for a taxi to the hotel. One thing to remember is that you can board a taxi from many places; for each type of taxi there are designated boarding points. I had a hard time navigating on the map—I had to go back and forth between Google Maps and the GRAB app to find the taxi boarding point. 


The taxi ride **cost around 8 RM**, but I tipped a total of **10 RM**.
Funny thing about the driver: he is a **police officer** by day and a taxi driver by night. I had a great chat with him; he was a local of **Indian descent**, grew up in **Malaysia**. I actually tipped him **2 RM** more. He asked me again, “Are you sure?” I realized they are very professional and don’t expect tips.

After I returned to my hotel and had some rest, I went out for **nightlife**.

## Nightlife at Bukit Bintang and Jalan Alor

I actually wanted to buy the KL City night bus tour ticket for the city night bus tour ride, but I was very late. So I went to **Bukit Bintang** and **Jalan Alor** tour and had some food. I had **juice for 5 RM**, **mango-watermelon for 15 RM**, and **food for 14.5 RM**.

Then I returned to the hotel, had a shower and refreshed.

**Then I purchased the KL City night bus ticket online** for **65 RM**.

After that I was bored at the hotel, so I went out again at midnight. I had some street food and tea at, I think, a Turkish-like vendor. Then I came to the hotel and found it hard to sleep.

Finally, I went to sleep at **7:00 am**.

## Total Cost: **226 RM**
