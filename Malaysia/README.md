# Preparation:

I was planning to go to **Malaysia** for quite a long time, as it is a developed country and also within my budget. After too much pressure from my university, I got the chance to visit during the **Eid-ul-Azha** vacation. So I purchased the ticket and booked and paid for **hotel bookings**.

The ticket costs around **53 K BDT**; normally you can get a round-trip ticket for about **44 K BDT**, but it was the Eid season, so the price was a bit high. **Note:** You should purchase a non-stop round-trip ticket—if you do one-way, you will not get a boarding pass from Bangladesh airport. Even if you do a multi-city ticket (i.e., one stop in a country like India), you will also not get a boarding pass easily, or if you do get one, you will face some hassle.
Ok, now the hotel booking cost around **15 K BDT** for **7 days**.

**So up to now, total cost was \[53 + 15] = 68 K BDT.**

I also did research for about **2 days** and created an **itinerary** for **7 days** in **Kuala Lumpur** and **Penang (George Town)**.

# 25 May, Depart from **Dhaka Airport**

**Time:** **8:00 pm**

I came to the airport at **4:30 pm**. I thought I was early, but oh boy—there was a huge line just at the entrance of the airport. There was a huge line for taking the boarding pass too. After that, I went to immigration immediately, as I knew there would be a huge line there too.

And there was…

<img src="images/Day 1/immigration_photo.jpg" style="width:50%;">

**I asked around to people and pretty soon realized why a country like Malaysia doesn’t trust our people and sees us with very low-class eyes. Many people go there on tourist visas but stay illegally, as their relative or some middleman is waiting.**

After the huge line at immigration, as everything of mine was OK, I was released before time.

For immigration (both ways) I brought the following documents:

1. **Passport**
2. **eVisa printout**
3. **Air ticket**
4. **Paid hotel bookings confirmation**
5. **Student ID card**
6. **Job agreement**
7. **Itinerary**
8. **Malaysia Digital Arrival Card** (submitted **3 days before**)
9. All files zipped on my Mac (photos, etc.)
10. Two **passport-size photos** (just in case, not for immigration, for other purposes)
11. **NID card**

At **9:30 pm** the plane departed. It was about **1 hour** late, which is OK I guess. But the whole plane journey wasn’t comfortable—the plane was overloaded. **But the food was amazing**, I have to say.

# 26 May at **Kuala Lumpur** (Day 1)

Arrived at the airport around **3:30 am**. Went to immigration. Was a little bit nervous, not gonna lie, as there were so many Bangladeshis—I even talked to some and found problems with their documentation and their intention.

When I went close to immigration, I saw three Bangladeshis who were stopped. I guess there were some problems with documentation or maybe their intention.

I talked with one person I found; the person was completely clueless. **As most of the people of our country.**

Then I turned on my **Devil-may-care, confidence mode**.

While presenting the documents, I first showed the visa and Digital Arrival Card, and spoke a line in English: **“Here is my visa and Digital Arrival Card.”** Then I gave my return ticket and booking, and spoke another line in English: **“Here is my return ticket and paid hotel booking.”** And that’s it. **Just two lines in English with a clear voice, and my immigration was done.**

The officer didn’t even check my other documents, as they are experienced and can mostly tell by looking at the person whether his intention is true or false.

But all I can say: **If your intention is true, be confident—that’s it.**

After everything was done, I purchased a SIM card. **Cost: 30 RM**.

I ate breakfast, **costing 17 RM**—it was a bit high, but I was extremely hungry.

Then I took an underground lift. On Floor 1, there was the **KLIA Ekspres** train that runs from the airport to **KL Sentral**, which is the city center.

**Train cost: 55 RM** 

After the train, I arrived at **KL Sentral**, and it was huge—I had a very hard time just to navigate.

Then I wanted to take a taxi, but the Grab app needed prepayment before giving the service. As it was night, I avoided that.

My hotel was around **3.8 km** away, so I decided to walk. 

<img src="images/Day 1/kl_sentral_to_hotel_map.png" style="width:50%;">

I had a hard time navigating the location and the roads, as there was a separate **walk** route for every street. Also, it was night, and morning light doesn’t come to Malaysia before **7 am**—it was around **6 am**.

Ok, while walking I found the streets of **KL** so well organized. Every single car follows traffic laws strictly. Even when the road is completely clear, the cars still don’t pass, which was really good. All the roads are very well color coded.

I took some pictures too. 

<img src="images/Day 1/early_skyscraper_photos.jpg" style="width:50%;">

After coming back to the hotel, I directly went to sleep. Early check-in had an extra cost: **50 RM**. 



I woke up at **3:00 pm**, didn’t waste time, and went for a walk around **Bukit Bintang**.

I followed my itinerary.



## Jalan Alor Street Food


I walked around and had lunch. **Lunch cost: 24 RM**. 

<img src="images/Day 1/jalan_alor_food.jpg" style="width:50%;">

---

## KL Aquaria

<img src="images/Day 1/aquaria_map.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Funny thing—the Aquaria is at the **KLCC Convention Centre**, where the **ASEAN Summit** was going on at the time. There was so much security. I was surprised—on a normal city hall that much security, but later realized why.

<img src="images/Day 1/convention_hall_photo.jpg" style="width:50%;">

**Aquaria cost: 75 RM**.

To be honest, a complete waste of money—Cox’s Bazar Radiant Sea World was more worth it. 

---

## KLCC Park

That was so worth it. Oh man, it was amazing. I wandered around the park. 

<img src="images/Day 1/park_entry.jpg" style="width:50%;">

I went to the center of the park. There it was: **Kuala Lumpur City**

**CITY of Skyscrapers**

<img src="images/Day 1/skyscraper_1.jpg" style="width:50%;">  
<img src="images/Day 1/skyscraper_2.jpg" style="width:50%;">  
<img src="images/Day 1/skyscraper_3.jpg" style="width:50%;">  
<img src="images/Day 1/skyscraper_4.jpg" style="width:50%;">

**Petronas Twin Towers** and KLCC Park photos. 

<img src="images/Day 1/petronas_towers.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Along the way, I purchased some drinks from the supermarket and some night food for the hotel, **costing 40 RM**. 


Later, I walked back to the hotel, visiting **Jalan Alor Road** for the night view. 

<img src="images/Day 1/jalan_alor_night.jpg" style="width:50%;">

That ended my day. It cost way more than expected because it was the first day and I had to figure out everything.

Total cost was around **310 RM**, including the ATM charge of **22 RM**.

### Total Day 1 cost was around **300 RM** or **9,000 BDT**.

Just one more thing before I go for today: as I am writing from my hotel after Day 1, I want to remind people coming to **Kuala Lumpur** that the hotel socket is not like ours.

<img src="images/Day 1/socket_photo.png" style="width:50%;">

Thank goodness I borrowed a power bank from my friend.

---
---



# Day 2: More City Travel and Top-of-the-City View

I woke up around **2:00 pm**. Then I had a cup of **coffee** at home.
I found that I had no charge on my **power bank**, so I walked to the hotel counter for an **adapter**, and they did help me with one. But unfortunately, it was not working. I kind of got freaked out—without my phone, it’s like losing an **eye**. So I planned to buy an adapter when I returned to the hotel after touring the city—keep that in mind.

> “If you travel to **Malaysia**, make sure to bring a **3-pin adapter**.”

Ok, after that I headed out for **KL Tower** at **3:00 pm**.

 <img src="images/Day 2/hotel_to_kl_tower_map.png" style="width:50%;">

## KL Tower

I was very tired after traveling around **2 km**, so I was sweaty. On the first floor of the **KL Tower**, I had a **juice**, costing **5 RM**.
In **Malaysia**, cost of juice, cane, and other stuff like **Coca-Cola** or **Pepsi** are not automatically determined—vendors have the right to set the prices.

Ok, after my drink, I bought a ticket for the observation deck, costing around **80 RM**.
The sky-deck ticket was **140 RM**, which was around **2K BDT** more, so I made a choice.
I saw the city from the sky deck, which is around **80 stories high**. 

<img src="images/Day 2/kl_tower_skydeck_view.jpg" style="width:50%;">

<img src="images/Day 2/kl_tower_skydeck_view1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

To be honest, I wasn’t that surprised by the top view. I actually had a better top view from **Sarangkot, Nepal**. Ok, I guess. Then I went to the ground floor and headed out.

## Masjid India

Then I headed for **Masjid India**. 


On my way, I had **lunch**, costing around **14.5 RM**. After that, I continued walking to **Masjid India**.

 <img src="images/Day 2/masjid_india.jpg" style="width:50%;">

It was not that surprising; it was ok, I guess. It was the time of **Asr salat**.

## Independence Square and Sultan Abdul Samad

I then headed for the **Independence Square** and **Sultan Abdul Samad**. 


I took some **photos** and continued **walking**. 

<img src="images/Day 2/independence_square_sultan_abdul_samad.jpg" style="width:50%;">

<img src="images/Day 2/independence_square_sultan_abdul_samad1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

## National Mosque of Malaysia

After that, I went to the **National Mosque of Malaysia**. 


I went for **Asr salat**. I saw there are separate sections for men and women; women had a place for salat at the back. 

<img src="images/Day 2/national_mosque.jpg" style="width:50%;">

<img src="images/Day 2/national_mosque1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

After all the walking, I became so tired and finally, for the first time, I used the **GRAB app** for a taxi to the hotel. One thing to remember is that you can board a taxi from many places; for each type of taxi there are designated boarding points. I had a hard time navigating on the map—I had to go back and forth between Google Maps and the GRAB app to find the taxi boarding point. 


The taxi ride **cost around 8 RM**, but I tipped a total of **10 RM**.
Funny thing about the driver: he is a **police officer** by day and a taxi driver by night. I had a great chat with him; he was a local of **Indian descent**, grew up in **Malaysia**. I actually tipped him **2 RM** more. He asked me again, “Are you sure?” I realized they are very professional and don’t expect tips.

After I returned to my hotel and had some rest, I went out for **nightlife**.

## Nightlife at Bukit Bintang and Jalan Alor

I actually wanted to buy the KL City night bus tour ticket for the city night bus tour ride, but I was very late. So I went to **Bukit Bintang** and **Jalan Alor** tour and had some food. I had **juice for 5 RM**, **mango-watermelon for 15 RM**, and **food for 14.5 RM**.

Then I returned to the hotel, had a shower and refreshed.

**Then I purchased the KL City night bus ticket online** for **65 RM**.

After that I was bored at the hotel, so I went out again at midnight. I had some street food and tea at, I think, a Turkish-like vendor. Then I came to the hotel and found it hard to sleep.

Finally, I went to sleep at **7:00 am**.

## Total Cost: **226 RM**

# Day 3: (Batu Cave and KL Night Bus Tour)

I woke up quite late, it was around **3:00 pm**. Yeah, that late—I slept through the morning because I actually wandered near my hotel at night for some nighttime snacks and drank a cup of tea.

## Batu Cave

Ok, then my schedule was to go to the **KL Sentral** station and then go to **Batu Cave** via the **KTM Komuter** train. But I did the math: if I did this, and then returned to catch the **8:00 pm** night bus, I would miss it. And boy, I was **extremely** right.

I used **GRAB** and booked a taxi ride from my hotel to **Batu Cave**, which cost only **18 RM**, a much cheaper route.



<img src="images/Day 3/hotel_to_batu_cave_map.png" style="width:50%;">

The cave was amazing, huge, **enormous**. I got so tired getting to the top and entering the cave. I did quite a bit of a photo session inside the cave.

<img src="images/Day 3/batu_cave_photo1.jpg" style="width:50%;">  
<img src="images/Day 3/batu_cave_photo2.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 3/batu_cave_photo3.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 3/batu_cave_photo4.jpg" style="width:50%;">

I also played around with a **pigeon** in front of the cave. 

<img src="images/Day 3/pigeon.jpg" style="width:50%;">

I met some fellow **Bangladeshi** students studying **CS in Malaysia**. I talked with them and learned about their internships and other experiences. We had a great laugh about our country too. The punch line they told me: “When you mention you are Bangladeshi, your value automatically drops to 30%.” 

<img src="images/Day 3/group_photo.jpg" style="width:50%;">

They also told me something more interesting: in **Singapore**, Bangladeshis are much respected, as they follow laws perfectly. Also, **Bengali** is the second language.

Then, as I mentioned, I wanted to ride the **KTM Komuter** train. So I went to the Batu Cave platform and bought a ticket costing **5.5 RM**.


It was already around **6:30 pm**, and my **8:00 pm** night bus time was getting near. Then I booked another **GRAB taxi**. Surprise—the taxi cost around **29 RM** from **KL Sentral** to **Sungei Wang Plaza**, which is way more than the **18 RM** price from my hotel to Batu Cave. But Batu Cave to my hotel is **11 km**, and KL Sentral to Wang Plaza is **3 km**. I guess it’s the city and this was peak time. 


So going to Batu Cave directly with Grab taxi cost **18 RM**, but coming back via KTM Komuter + taxi to Wang Plaza cost around **35 RM**.


## KL City Night Bus Tour

Ok, as I waited for the bus (which was around **8:00 pm**, and it was **7:20 pm**), I thought, why not try something from a brand like **Pizza Hut** or **Burger King**?

Then I had a burger at **Burger King**.


After the burger, I headed to the **KL City Night Bus Tour** at **Sungei Wang Plaza**. I think the plaza is some sort of famous city hall, like New Market of Dhaka. I actually found so many stalls along with places for karate, go-karting, etc.

Ok, after that I went for the city night bus. The bus ride was about **2 hours**, and it covered:

- **KL Tower** 🗼
- **Chinatown** 🏮
- **Central Market** 🎨
- **Little India** 🎊
- **KL Sentral** 🚉
- **National Palace** 🏰
- **Merdeka Square** 🏞️
- **KLCC – The Twin Towers** 🌉

<img src="images/Day 3/city_night_bus_tour1.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 3/city_night_bus_tour2.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 3/city_night_bus_tour3.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 3/city_night_bus_tour4.jpg" style="width:50%;">

After the bus ride, I went to **Jalan Alor Road** for some food.


I walked back to the hotel and got some night snacks for my bedtime. I took some night food **10 RM**.


## Total cost Day 3: **102 RM**

# Day 4, 29 May, moving day from KL to Georgetown.

didn’t sleep at night, woke up early and left for the **ETS train** at **7:00 am**, took a Grab for **12 RM**

Boy, what do you know, all **tickets** for **ETS train** are **sold out** for **29, 30 May**. I kind of got a shock; I asked around, “Is there any other solution?” I really wanted to ride that train, as it is a fast train covering **360 KM** in just **4 hours**, from **KL Sentral** to **Butterworth**.

Ok, then what, I remembered there **were buses** when I first came to **KL Sentral** and was figuring out my ways on the first day. So I navigated there too, asked around—**all tickets to Butterworth** are sold, only **8:00 pm** available.

**Drama.** Kind of got a shock, started looking for a flight immediately, and almost did the **12:00 pm** flight booking, but luck.

**Luck**, I saw a Google sponsored ad, and clicked—it showed buses leaving from some place called **TBS** to **Butterworth**, with seats available every **10 minutes**.

So I did not do the flight booking, took a Grab to **TBS**.


<img src="images/Day 4/kl_sentral_to_tbs_map.png" style="width:50%;">


Ok, there I purchased the first ticket I got hold of, which was at **9:00 am**, and it was already **8:45 am**.

**\[Ticket cost: 53 RM]** – wayyyyy cheaper than flight.

One thing I should mention is that they ask for **Passport** to do the ticketing.

<img src="images/Day 4/tbs_to_butterworth_map.png" style="width:50%;">

From **9:00 am** to **3:45 pm**, the journey was so comfortable, I slept through most of it. The roads were nice.

Then we came to **Butterworth**, and I found out that I left the **ferry behind**.
The bus conductor didn’t understand a word of English; he was telling me something, he was annoyed, I was annoyed.

**A kind—and I think very educated—woman sitting in front of me told me that the ferry is quite far behind; I have to take the Grab taxi.**

I took Grab for **15 RM**, original price was **13 RM**; for the first time one driver asked for a **2 RM** tip. In my entire journey, this happened only today.


Took the ferry to **Georgetown**.

**Ferry cost was 2 RM.**

<img src="images/Day 4/ferry_butterworth_to_georgetown_map.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Immediately entered the hotel, which was very nearby.

**[Extra tax – 30 RM]**

After shower I immediately headed out without spending any time.

I stayed at **Queen Street**, where my hotel is.


I first ate lunch at **Nasi Kandar** for **15 RM**.


## Visiting street arts.

Went to **Chulia Street** and **Armenian Street**, to watch the **street arts**. 

<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts1.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts2.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts3.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts4.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts5.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts6.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts7.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts8.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts9.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/street_arts10.jpg" style="width:50%;">

These places were very nearby, within **400 m**. So just by walking I went there.

**I always had to ask people to take pictures of me; I had to find young people, as older people don’t know how to take a good picture.**

Then when I asked for a picture from two people who looked like Bangladeshis, they told me **“Ok tule dicci”**, which means “Ok, capturing your photo.” I was surprised; I had a great chat with them. Learned that they have been here working for around **2 years**. They offered to take me to **Chew Jetty**, one of the most visited places near the sea.


**Normally, whenever I meet people who are kind to me for no reason, I remain suspicious and wait for any bad clues in talking or suspicious acting.**
**But these two people were so kind at heart and down to earth, there were zero signs.**

<img src="images/Day 4/chew_jetty_photos_bd.jpg" style="width:50%;">

## Chew Jetty


I had a great time with them; they were funny, realistic, told me all about Georgetown and their experiences. 

<img src="images/Day 4/chew_jetty_photos.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 4/chew_jetty_photos1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

After that we came to the **Masjid Kapitan Keling** for **Maghrib**, met with more Bangladeshi brothers.

**One thing I should mention is that they were here illegally, but that didn’t matter to them; they have built a great community here in this area by avoiding police.**

We laughed together, then performed **Maghrib salat** at the mosque.

 <img src="images/Day 4/kapitan_keling.jpg" style="width:50%;">

The Kapitan Keling Mosque is around **200 years** old.

After that, one of the Bangladeshi brothers called **Sazid** told me to knock him around **10:00 pm**, he would take me to the nightlife of the city.

**Again, I should say, there was no complexity in them, just kind and down to earth.**

I got out around **10:00 pm**.

We went to **Padang Kota**, meaning field; it was near the ocean.

## Padang Kota

The kind brother paid for my tea, even though I insisted so much. We enjoyed **Padang Kota**, vibrant field and seaside. 


<img src="images/Day 4/padang_kota_photos.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Then wandered around the city a little bit at night. And it was around **1:00 am**. We came to Masjid Kapitan Keling.

I had dinner here, and let me tell you, this is the best food I had on my entire trip. Cost was around **10 RM**.


It was roasted chicken with other soups.


I then headed home.

## Total cost was around **170 RM** with water, juice, and other stuff (some I missed to mention).

# Day 5, Penang Hill Tour Day

Got up very late. Showered and got ready.
Had just a **packet of coffee** that I brought.

It was already around **1:00 pm**, so I took my laundry to a kind lady’s laundry shop nearby.

**[Laundry cost: 15 RM]**

Then I did Jumma salat at the **Masjid Kapitan Keling** near me.
I have to say, the khutba was in Malay, and it was around **30 minutes** long—the salat started at **2:00 pm**.

After salat I had **lunch**.

**[Lunch: 14 RM]**

Funny story: I was ordering in English. The waiter (Bangladeshi—he recognized me from last night when I was chatting with Sazid vai) told me, “This is **GORU**.” I laughed; he laughed. He wanted to know my plan, and was very kind and hospitable.

After lunch, I took a Grab to **Penang Hill Station**. 

## Penang Hill

**[Grab cost: 12 RM]** only

**Penang hill Train ticket: 30 RM** 

<img src="images/Day 5/train_photos.jpg" style="width:50%;">

I saw an amazing view of the city from the top of Penang Hill. 


<img src="images/Day 5/penang_hill_top_view.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 5/penang_hill_top_view1.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 5/penang_hill_top_view2.jpg" style="width:50%;">

After that I went to visit **The Habitat**.


**[Habitat ticket: 60 RM]** way overpriced, but I took some good photos. 

<img src="images/Day 5/habitat_photo.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 5/habitat_photo1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Whenever I search Penang, I get to see **Curtis Crest**, which is a round-shaped platform. So I went there.

 <img src="images/Day 5/curtis_crest.jpg" style="width:50%;">
 <img src="images/Day 5/curtis_crest1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

Then I wandered around a bit and took the train down to return.
One thing I noticed: the down train and up train are programmed so well that they cross each other at a perfect loop point at exactly the same time, then continue on single tracks.

## Kek Lok Si Temple

It was nearby—around a **1 km** walk—but I was tired and had already seen so many temples, so I just headed back to Penang Hill Station for Grab.
Finding a car on Grab was hard, as there were so many people at the station. Finally, after around **15 minutes**, I found one.

**[Grab to Masjid: 29 RM]**

I took my laundry back, went to the hotel, had a shower, and came back out for **lunch**. Wandered around the city. Then back to the hotel for **noodles**, then again went out for pizza—but didn’t find any open. Instead I found **Hema Hema Artisan Ice Cream** with a huge line of Chinese and white people. So I joined the line to see what all the fuss was about. 

<img src="images/Day 5/hema_hema_queue.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 5/hema_hema_queue1.jpg" style="width:50%;">

**[Ice cream: 13 RM]**

**The best vanilla ice cream I’ve had in my entire life.**

After some time I found no pizza shop open—it was around **9:00 pm**. So I had **rice** for **12 RM**, not as good as last night.


I saw many famous places with queues in front— even the roast-chicken spot I went to had a huge line because the food is very tasty. Also, one place that’s open during the day (where I ate today) has a nearby spot open only at night.

Then finally I did one last round of the nightlife and headed back to the hotel, bringing some nighttime snacks for **10 RM**.

Ok, another thing happened on my way home. I wanted to buy water, and as I was about to pay, a **Bangladeshi** brother asked me where I was from—he found me interesting with my camera, walking like a tourist. I told him I was Bangladeshi. Then he insisted on not letting me pay for the water—told me the vendor was his friend. He even asked if I’d had dinner and wanted to arrange that too. I insisted on paying, but he said not to take any money. Then I learned he has been here for more than **17 years**.

**The level of kindness these Bangladeshi brothers offered—I will remember that; they are so down to earth.**

Also, I really wanted to drive a motorcycle in Malaysia, but to be honest, I was nervous about their strict laws. But this brother had a scooter, and he just handed it over to me—I drove, oh, by the speed!

Another thing: I was walking home, and along the way I met a British traveler. He saw me filming arts with my camera and asked if I had a YouTube channel. We got to talking—he told me he’s been traveling for **5 months** (2 in Thailand, 1 in Bali). I recommended my journey in Nepal and suggested places. We had a long chat. Then I finally headed home.

## Total cost: **210 RM**

# Day 6 (Beach day) Batu Ferringhi:

I woke up again late, around **2:00 pm**. Freshened up and showered.

Then I started doing my **AI assignment**. Yeah, I did that—I did my assignment from my hotel in Malaysia, haiiii SUST CSE.

But I couldn’t finish it, so I then took the help of my friend **Sanjay Das**.

Then it was already around **3:00 pm**, I headed out. Had tea for **3 RM**.
**[Tea: 3 RM]**

Then I had lunch.

**[Lunch: 12.3 RM]**

During that time, I learned how to use the Rapid bus to Batu Ferringhi. I can only pay using **change**, no card—only cash or Rapid bus pass. From last night’s interaction with my Bangladeshi brother, he told me to take the **101 Bus**.

 <img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach5.jpg" style="width:50%;">

So I took the **101 Bus**,

**[Bus fare: 2.70 RM]**

<img src="images/Day 6/masjid_to_batu_ferringhi_map.png" style="width:50%;">

## Batu Ferringhi Beach:

<img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach1.jpg" style="width:50%;">
<img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach2.jpg" style="width:50%;">
 <img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach3.jpg" style="width:50%;">
 <img src="images/Day 6/batu_ferringhi_beach4.jpg" style="width:50%;">


I walked around the beach—I noticed that the beach sand particles are a bit different than the ones in Cox’s Bazar or Saint Martin. They are bigger.

I walked around and enjoyed the beach a bit.

I accidentally wet my shoes. I had a hard time drying them.

After the beach time, I took a Grab taxi back to Masjid Kapitan Keling

**[Grab taxi: 24 RM]**

The taxi driver was Chinese; I had a great time chatting with her. She told me so many interesting things about Georgetown and Malaysia—like how the original Malays get discounts on everything and the Chinese don’t. Also, there is racism against Chinese-blood people by the Malays. She also told me Malay men have a bad reputation for being disloyal. I continued chatting with her the whole trip. **She told me that she never met a Bangladeshi man who can communicate in English like me**—the men from Bangladesh here have a hard time explaining themselves. But she likes Bangladeshis, as they are hardworking, not lazy, and came here to take care of their family by sending money home.

I talked with her a lot more and heard the one-sided story of Malaysia from a Chinese perspective.

After coming to Masjid Kapitan, I bought sandals, as I had already wetted mine

**[Sandals: 14.90 RM]**

I went to the hotel and took some rest. Then came out to have a pizza.

**[Pizza: 22 RM]**

Then I had a Coke for **3.6 RM**

**[Coke: 3.6 RM]**

Then I went home, took some rest, showered, packed everything, and double-checked everything.

Then I checked out of the hotel and took my **50 RM** deposit.

I went for the bus:

**[Bus ticket: 55 RM]**

It was **12:15 am, 1 Jun**.

# Day 7 (Return day):

The bus stopped around **5:30 am**.

I stayed some time at the **KL Sentral**.

Then I had some breakfast for **10 RM**
**[Breakfast: 10 RM]**

Then I took the **KLIA Ekspres** to the airport.

On the first day I did not experience the speed of the train, as it was around **6:00 am**. But today it was around **7:00 am**, and morning light was visible. So I experienced the speed of the train.

After coming to the airport, I took some time to rest and had a large Burger King breakfast.

**[Burger King: 29 RM]**

At **11:30 am**, I stood in the boarding-pass line to collect my boarding pass. My flight was at **3:50 pm**, but as the Bangladeshi line was so long, they started early.

While standing in line, I had a weird experience: I saw many Bangladeshi **dalal** dealing with people in the line to pass gold over Dhaka airport (the limit is 100 gm, and one person is taking 200 gm, so another guy gave the dalal’s number).

I was the only one in my line who was just traveling. I had no luggage—one person literally dragged me and told me to carry some luggage for them to Bangladesh; they would pay me money for this. I found it very annoying and refused. They were annoyed.

I actually understood: that’s how Bangladeshi people working abroad send things home.

They even have a fixed rate for carrying things—like if you take one extra mobile, they will give you 200 TK as a fixed rate.

**But among other things, why our country’s people don’t get much respect: I literally understood. There are just too many of us, and we are so trained to be uncivilized—everywhere we go, there is a huuuuge line.**

**But I understand, as it is my country. Population is our weakness. But hopefully one day it will be our greatest strength.**

In the flight, I saw people arguing, screaming with the flight attendant, as the flight was delayed.

After all the drama, the flight landed at the airport. During the flight I had a very fun time chatting with two Bangladeshi brothers sitting beside me. When saying goodbye, they shared that they also loved the chat and wished me good luck.

After immigration, I went to the domestic terminal and took a flight back to Sylhet.

**[Flight cost: 5 K BDT]**
