🌟 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞:
I want to express heartfelt thanks to the 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐢 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐬 living in George Town. Yesterday, one brother kindly took me around the city. Today, another brother met me while I was buying water at the hotel lobby. After a short conversation and realizing I'm also Bangladeshi, he told the shop owner not to charge me. We had a great chat – he’s been living here for over 17 years and hasn’t returned to Bangladesh once. I gave him some updates from home. It was a truly touching encounter.
💖 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
George Town has a 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐭𝐡. People here are more cordial, the vibe is calm yet vibrant. I genuinely started to fall in love with the town. Wish I didn’t have to leave so soon – I should’ve planned to stay at least one more week. The charm, the culture, the people… it’s something I’ll remember forever. 🌺

And took the down train to return. 


ONe thing I notice, down train and up train are programmed so well that, at the excat time the cross each other at a perfect location, where there are a loop, after that aagain single lane.





## KEK LOK SI temple

I have to say, there had a hard time finding a car using GRAB. as there were so many pepole near me at the statin doing so.


FInally after around 15 minutes found one.

Took my laundry back.
