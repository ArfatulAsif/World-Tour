# Day 5, Penang Hill Tour Day

Got up very late. Showered and got ready.
Had just a **packet of coffee** that I brought.

It was already around **1:00 pm**, so I took my laundry to a kind lady’s laundry shop nearby.

**[Laundry cost: 15 RM]**

Then I did Jumma salat at the **Masjid Kapitan Keling** near me.
I have to say, the khutba was in Malay, and it was around **30 minutes** long—the salat started at **2:00 pm**.

After salat I had **lunch**.

**[Lunch: 14 RM]**

Funny story: I was ordering in English. The waiter (Bangladeshi—he recognized me from last night when I was chatting with Sazid vai) told me, “This is **GORU**.” I laughed; he laughed. He wanted to know my plan, and was very kind and hospitable.

After lunch, I took a Grab to **Penang Hill Station**. 

## Penang Hill

**[Grab cost: 12 RM]** only

**Penang hill Train ticket: 30 RM**

I saw an amazing view of the city from the top of Penang Hill.

After that I went to visit **The Habitat**.


**[Habitat ticket: 60 RM]** way overpriced, but I took some good photos.

Whenever I search Penang, I get to see **Curtis Crest**, which is a round-shaped platform. So I went there.

Then I wandered around a bit and took the train down to return.
One thing I noticed: the down train and up train are programmed so well that they cross each other at a perfect loop point at exactly the same time, then continue on single tracks.

## Kek Lok Si Temple

It was nearby—around a **1 km** walk—but I was tired and had already seen so many temples, so I just headed back to Penang Hill Station for Grab.
Finding a car on Grab was hard, as there were so many people at the station. Finally, after around **15 minutes**, I found one.

**[Grab to Masjid: 29 RM]**

I took my laundry back, went to the hotel, had a shower, and came back out for **lunch**. Wandered around the city. Then back to the hotel for **noodles**, then again went out for pizza—but didn’t find any open. Instead I found **Hema Hema Artisan Ice Cream** with a huge line of Chinese and white people. So I joined the line to see what all the fuss was about.

**[Ice cream: 13 RM]**

**The best vanilla ice cream I’ve had in my entire life.**

After some time I found no pizza shop open—it was around **9:00 pm**. So I had **rice** for **12 RM**, not as good as last night.


I saw many famous places with queues in front— even the roast-chicken spot I went to had a huge line because the food is very tasty. Also, one place that’s open during the day (where I ate today) has a nearby spot open only at night.

Then finally I did one last round of the nightlife and headed back to the hotel, bringing some nighttime snacks for **10 RM**.

Ok, another thing happened on my way home. I wanted to buy water, and as I was about to pay, a **Bangladeshi** brother asked me where I was from—he found me interesting with my camera, walking like a tourist. I told him I was Bangladeshi. Then he insisted on not letting me pay for the water—told me the vendor was his friend. He even asked if I’d had dinner and wanted to arrange that too. I insisted on paying, but he said not to take any money. Then I learned he has been here for more than **17 years**.

**The level of kindness these Bangladeshi brothers offered—I will remember that; they are so down to earth.**

Also, I really wanted to drive a motorcycle in Malaysia, but to be honest, I was nervous about their strict laws. But this brother had a scooter, and he just handed it over to me—I drove, oh, by the speed!

Another thing: I was walking home, and along the way I met a British traveler. He saw me filming arts with my camera and asked if I had a YouTube channel. We got to talking—he told me he’s been traveling for **5 months** (2 in Thailand, 1 in Bali). I recommended my journey in Nepal and suggested places. We had a long chat. Then I finally headed home.

## Total cost: **210 RM**
