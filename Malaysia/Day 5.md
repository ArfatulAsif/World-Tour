And took the down train to return. 


ONe thing I notice, down train and up train are programmed so well that, at the excat time the cross each other at a perfect location, where there are a loop, after that aagain single lane.





## KEK LOK SI temple

I have to say, there had a hard time finding a car using GRAB. as there were so many pepole near me at the statin doing so.


FInally after around 15 minutes found one.
