# Day 6 (Beach day) Batu Ferringhi:

I woke up again late, around **2:00 pm**. Freshened up and showered.

Then I started doing my **AI assignment**. Yeah, I did that—I did my assignment from my hotel in Malaysia, haiiii SUST CSE.

But I couldn’t finish it, so I then took the help of my friend **Sanjay Das**.

Then it was already around **3:00 pm**, I headed out. Had tea for **3 RM**.
**[Tea: 3 RM]**

Then I had lunch.

**[Lunch: 12.3 RM]**

During that time, I learned how to use the Rapid bus to Batu Ferringhi. I can only pay using **change**, no card—only cash or Rapid bus pass. From last night’s interaction with my Bangladeshi brother, he told me to take the **101 Bus**.

So I took the **101 Bus**,

**[Bus fare: 2.70 RM]**

I walked around the beach—I noticed that the beach sand particles are a bit different than the ones in Cox’s Bazar or Saint Martin. They are bigger.

I walked around and enjoyed the beach a bit.

I accidentally wet my shoes. I had a hard time drying them.

After the beach time, I took a Grab taxi back to Masjid Kapitan Keling

**[Grab taxi: 24 RM]**

The taxi driver was Chinese; I had a great time chatting with her. She told me so many interesting things about Georgetown and Malaysia—like how the original Malays get discounts on everything and the Chinese don’t. Also, there is racism against Chinese-blood people by the Malays. She also told me Malay men have a bad reputation for being disloyal. I continued chatting with her the whole trip. **She told me that she never met a Bangladeshi man who can communicate in English like me**—the men from Bangladesh here have a hard time explaining themselves. But she likes Bangladeshis, as they are hardworking, not lazy, and came here to take care of their family by sending money home.

I talked with her a lot more and heard the one-sided story of Malaysia from a Chinese perspective.

After coming to Masjid Kapitan, I bought sandals, as I had already wetted mine

**[Sandals: 14.90 RM]**

I went to the hotel and took some rest. Then came out to have a pizza.

**[Pizza: 22 RM]**

Then I had a Coke for **3.6 RM**

**[Coke: 3.6 RM]**

Then I went home, took some rest, showered, packed everything, and double-checked everything.

Then I checked out of the hotel and took my **50 RM** deposit.

I went for the bus:

**[Bus ticket: 55 RM]**

It was **12:15 am, 1 Jun**.

# Day 7 (Return day):

The bus stopped around **5:30 am**.

I stayed some time at the **KL Sentral**.

Then I had some breakfast for **10 RM**
**[Breakfast: 10 RM]**

Then I took the **KLIA Ekspres** to the airport.

On the first day I did not experience the speed of the train, as it was around **6:00 am**. But today it was around **7:00 am**, and morning light was visible. So I experienced the speed of the train.

After coming to the airport, I took some time to rest and had a large Burger King breakfast.

**[Burger King: 29 RM]**

At **11:30 am**, I stood in the boarding-pass line to collect my boarding pass. My flight was at **3:50 pm**, but as the Bangladeshi line was so long, they started early.

While standing in line, I had a weird experience: I saw many Bangladeshi **dalal** dealing with people in the line to pass gold over Dhaka airport (the limit is 100 gm, and one person is taking 200 gm, so another guy gave the dalal’s number).

I was the only one in my line who was just traveling. I had no luggage—one person literally dragged me and told me to carry some luggage for them to Bangladesh; they would pay me money for this. I found it very annoying and refused. They were annoyed.

I actually understood: that’s how Bangladeshi people working abroad send things home.

They even have a fixed rate for carrying things—like if you take one extra mobile, they will give you 200 TK as a fixed rate.

**But among other things, why our country’s people don’t get much respect: I literally understood. There are just too many of us, and we are so trained to be uncivilized—everywhere we go, there is a huuuuge line.**

**But I understand, as it is my country. Population is our weakness. But hopefully one day it will be our greatest strength.**

In the flight, I saw people arguing, screaming with the flight attendant, as the flight was delayed.

After all the drama, the flight landed at the airport. During the flight I had a very fun time chatting with two Bangladeshi brothers sitting beside me. When saying goodbye, they shared that they also loved the chat and wished me good luck.

After immigration, I went to the domestic terminal and took a flight back to Sylhet.

**[Flight cost: 5 K BDT]**

# And that’s it—this is the end of my journey.
