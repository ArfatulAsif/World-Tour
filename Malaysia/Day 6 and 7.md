Also there exists recism on chinese blood people by the malayan. She also told me the malayan man, have a bad reputeation for being disloyal. I continues chatting, with her the hole trip. **She told me that she never met a bangladeshi man who can communicate in english like me**, the men from bangladeshi here, have a hard time explaining themself. 
But she like bangladeshi, As they are hard working, not lazy and came here to take care of their family by sending money home.

Then I took the **KLIA ekspress** to airport


At first day I didnot expericne the speed of the train, as it was around 6 am. But today it was around 7 am, and moring light was visible. So I experienced the speed of the train.


After comeing to ariport. I took some time and rested and had a large burger king breakfast. 


**[Burger king - 29 RM]**


At 11.30 am, I stood in the boarding pass line to collect my boarding pass. My flight was at 3.50 pm, but as the bangladeshi line was so long, they started early. 


while standing on the line, I had some wiired experience, I saw many bangladeshi "DAlal", dealing with people on the line, to pass gold over dhaka airport, (the limit is 100 gm, and one people is taking 200 gm, so another guy gave the dalals number). 


I was the only one in my line who was just travelling. I had no laggugage, one people literrally drag me, and told me to carry some laugage for them to bangladesh, they will pay money for this. I found it very annoyeing, and refused. They were annoyed.

I acutally understood. Thats how bangladeshi people working abroud send things home. 

They even had a fix rate for carrying thing.s Like if you take one extra moble, they will give you 200 tk as fix rate. 


**But among other thing, why our coutnry people dont get much respect. I literally understood. They are just too much of us. and We are so trained to be uncivilied, everywhere we go, theere is a huuuuuge line**

**But I understand, as it is my country. Population is our weakness. But hopefully one day it will be our greatest strength**



In the flight, I say people arguing, screaming, with the flight atttended. as the flight was delayed. 




AFter all the drama, flight landed at the airport. During flight I had a very fun time chatting with 2 Bangladeshi brother seating beside me. When saying goodby, they shared that they also loved the chat, and wished me good luck.



After immigration and went to the domestic terminal. And took a flight back to sylhet

**[flight cost - 5k]**



# And thats it, this is the end of my journy
