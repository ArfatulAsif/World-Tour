## Day 1: Arrival and Exploring Police Bazar

Make sure to reach the Dawki Tamabil border early, around 10 am, for immigration. After completing the immigration process, walk out of India's immigration and take a shared taxi (Rs. 500-700 per person) or, if you prefer a more local experience, walk to Dawki Bazar and take a sumo for Rs. 300 per person (note: the last sumo departs before 1 pm).

The ride will take you to Shillong’s Police Bazar, and by the time you reach, it's already evening.

Once you arrive, find a hotel (don't forget to bargain!) and check in. After settling in, step out and enjoy the vibrant nightlife at Police Bazar. There are six roads that converge at the heart of the market. Take a stroll and immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere.
